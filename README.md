Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, launched its program in 2016. Since then, it has grown to a fleet of **5,824 bicycles** across **692 geotracked stations**. The system allows users to unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station, providing flexibility and convenience.  
Cyclistic offers three types of pricing plans:  
- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes

*Director of Marketing*, has identified a key opportunity to convert **casual riders** into **annual members** to ensure long-term growth and customer retention. I am parterning with the team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide cyclistic marketing strategy and to analyze casual riders vs. annual members' behavior for developing strategies to convert casual riders to annual memberships.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1. - Average Rde Length by Bike Type
